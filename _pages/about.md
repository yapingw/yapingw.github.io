Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD candidate in economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE), under the supervision of [Prof. Christian Brownlees](https://ctbrownlees.github.io/).

My primary research field is econometric theory, focusing on high-dimensional modeling, factor models, quantile regression, and forecasting techniques, with additional interests in machine learning and empirical finance.

I am currently on the 2025-2026 Job Market.
