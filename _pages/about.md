Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/econ) and [Barcelona School of Economics (BSE)](https://bse.eu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Christian Brownlees](https://ctbrownlees.github.io/).

My primary research field is econometric theory, focusing on high-dimensional modeling, factor models, quantile regression, and forecasting techniques, with additional interests in machine learning and empirical finance.

My CV is [here](https://yapingw.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
